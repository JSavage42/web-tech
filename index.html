      <h2>A Little Bit About Me</h2>

      <p>I am a current full-time student in the Bachelor of Science in Information
      	Technology (BSIT) program at the University of Kansas &ndash; Edwards Campus
      	in Overland Park, KS. I am very interested in IT in general and specifically
      	Web Development, Database and Systems Administration. I am a father of two
      	very beautiful daughters and am a stay-at-home dad when I am not at school.
      	I spent 6 years in the military prior to starting college and it has been a
      	great	adventure learning and getting back to a non-military life. I am looking
      	for potential career opportunities and am forever seeking more knowledge of
      	Information Technology and the world around us.</p>

      <h2 id="projectsec">Projects That I Have Done</h2>
    <ol id="proj">
    	<li>I created this website by hand typed (in Atom) HTML5, CSS3, and a little
    		bit of Javascript.</li>
    	<li>I participated in the Federal Reserve&#39;s Code-A-Thon in 2017. Our code
    		can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/JASavage42/mentr">GitHub
    			Link</a>. My contribution:
    			<a href="https://github.com/JASavage42/codeathonproject">GitHub Link</a>.
    			We wanted to challenge ourselves and we built an Android application which
    			none of us had done. I also researched Firebase during this project.</li>
    	<li>I created the CSS layout for a subreddit that I moderate. Source code
    		found here:
    		<a href="https://github.com/JSavage42/jsavage42/blob/master/thechiefskingdomcss">
    			GitHub link</a>.</li>
    	<li>I wrote a couple of PowerShell scripts during my internship in the summer
    		of 2017. I cannot share those since I made them on company time. However, one
    		automated creating a user and adding them to the correct OU in ADUC. Another
    		Script copied the member of from one user and added another user to those
    		groups.</li>
    	<li>March 2018, I was a part of a group of 8 who participated in the
    		<a href="http://www.nationalccdc.org/index.php">At Large Collegiate Cyber
    			Defense Competition</a> where we placed 3rd in a group of about 15 teams
    			from all over the country. My duties were Active Directory and Web
    			Services.</li>
    	<li>For a Course at KU I made a BMI calculator using
    		<a href="http://jason-savage.com/bmi/bmi.html">Javascript</a> and then
    		converted it to using <a href="http://jason-savage.com/bmi/bmi.php">PHP.
